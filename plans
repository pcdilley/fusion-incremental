Black color scheme with each particle represented by their alpha line color.

Start with no walls, buildable with higher tier atoms, each wall requiring higher tiers in addition to more of the lower tier atoms?

Hydrogen spawn has a short cooldown/charge time, to limit spamming particles.  Starting temp is low, to give more time for collision.

Shrink visuals for atom while keeping their current physical size (or maybe a bit smaller).

Feynman diagram could be dynamically composed from svg animations.

Hydrogen can be used to buy hydrogen spawners, with exponential cost scaling.

Photons used to increase heat?  Heat increasing with each successful fuse?  Later upgrade to allow neutrinos to add to heat? (would likely be too much heat)

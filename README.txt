Fusion Incremental is a game about nuclear fusion.

Right now it's mostly an excuse to dig into nuclear fusion and practice javascript at the same time, but hopefully will become a reasonably robust simulator.

To play, open fusionGame.html in a browser that supports HTML5 Canvas elements.  Tested on Brave.

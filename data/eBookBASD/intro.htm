<p><b><i><font size=+1>I. Introduction</font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This handbook is designed to provide a selection
of the most important and frequently used atomic spectroscopic data in
an easily accessible format. The compilation includes data for the neutral
and singly-ionized atoms of all elements hydrogen through einsteinium (<i>Z
=</i> 1-99). The wavelengths, intensities, and spectrum assignments are
given in a table for each element, and the data for the approximately 12,000
lines of all elements are also collected into a single table, sorted by
wavelength (a "finding list").
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More complete data for a smaller number of
the most persistent lines of each spectrum are given in additional tables
for each element. In addition to the wavelengths and intensities, the energy
levels and transition probabilities (where available) are listed for a
total of about 2,350 lines in these tables. We also give a separate table
of energy level data for each spectrum which, although incomplete, includes
levels additional to those involved in the persistent-line transitions.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More complete data than those selected for
this Handbook can usually be found in references given with the tables
for particular spectra. The data from most of the NIST compilations we
have used are available online from the Atomic Spectra Database (ASD; see
<a href="#MFKM99">[MFKM99]</a>). In addition to more extensive data for
many of the spectra in this Handbook, the ASD has data for higher ionization
stages of many elements and includes the references.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although we have made heavy use of previous
compilations, our tables for the great majority of elements include at
least some data compiled by us from more recent original literature and,
in some cases, from unpublished material. Our most extensive use of data
from the original literature has been for the heavier elements. Although
the data are incomplete, our wavelength and energy level tables for these
elements, especially, comprise a supplement to the ASD. For example, the
current version of the ASD includes energy-level data for only two spectra
(Mo I, II) of the 72 spectra of the neutral and singly-ionized atoms of
the elements Rb to Ba (Z=37-56) and Hf to Ra (Z=72-88). No complete and
critical compilations of energy levels have appeared for most of these
spectra since vols. 2 and 3 of Atomic Energy Levels <a href="#M52">[M52</a>,
<a href="#M58">M58</a>]. For the actinide elements Ac - Es (Z =89-99),
we were able to rely almost entirely on the very complete compilation by
Blaise and Wyart <a href="#BW92b">[BW92b]</a>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some spectra, especially some of the lighter
elements, we have taken data from existing compilations that have been
superseded by data reported in more recent literature.
<p><b><i><font size=+1>II. Atomic Data Tables</font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small selection of non-spectroscopic atomic
data has been provided for each element. Included are the atomic number
and weight and a list of naturally occurring isotopes, including the isotopic
mass, the relative abundance, the nuclear spin (in units of h/2<img SRC="pi.gif" ALT="Pi" height=9 width=11>),
and the magnetic moment (in units of nuclear magnetons). For elements with
no naturally occurring isotopes, the most commonly observed isotopes are
listed. These data are taken from J. Emsley <a href="#E95">[E95]</a>.
<p><b><i><font size=+1>III. Strong Line Tables</font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For each of the elements a list of the strongest
lines in the spectra of the neutral and singly-ionized atoms has been compiled.
This list includes the wavelength, the ionization stage, the reference
for the wavelength measurement, and an intensity. Unless otherwise noted,
the spectroscopic data in this Handbook pertain to the naturally occurring
isotopic mix for each element.
<p><b><font size=+0>A. Wavelengths</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wavelengths for many spectra have been
taken from Reader et al. <a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a>. Wavelengths given
to three decimal places in <a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a> have a stated
uncertainty of less than 0.001 &Aring;, and many of the two-place wavelengths
in <a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a> are rounded off from three-place values
in the original literature.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laboratory observations carried out since the
publication of <a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a> have yielded improved wavelength
data for many spectra, including more accurate wavelengths, increased range
of wavelength coverage, and more reliable assignments of observed lines
to particular spectra. We have used more recent data for many of the spectra.
However, it is important to note that our retention of wavelengths from
<a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a> for any particular spectrum does not imply
that more accurate data do not now exist.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In compiling data from the original literature,
we have in many cases departed from the practice of <a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a>
by quoting wavelengths without rounding off, especially in cases where
the literature values were given to three or fewer decimal places. The
original references should be consulted for uncertainty estimates.
<p><b><font size=+0>B. Intensities</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the other tabulated data, the relative
intensities are not basic data and must be used with caution. The relative
intensities of the spectral lines observed for any element depend upon
the light source and excitation conditions. Thus, even if the relative
intensities observed in a particular experiment are adjusted to correct
for the wavelength dependence of the sensitivity of the spectrometer and
detector, the intensities will in general be different from relative intensities
given by a previous observer or tabulated in a compilation such as this
one. With a caveat that users should keep these considerations in mind,
we list a relative intensity for each line. For some lines the wavelengths
are so close to another that it was impossible to make two separate intensity
measurements. For those lines the intensity of the blended line is given
for each and both intensities are marked with an asterisk.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For uniformity we have assigned an intensity
of 1000 to the strongest line(s) of each spectrum. In most cases the chosen
line (or lines) can reasonably be regarded as the ultimate line (Sec IV).
The relative intensities for most spectra here are based on values from
<a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a>. We have attempted to give improved intensities
for some spectra by using more recent and apparently more accurate data
than those available to the compilers of <a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be noted that the intensities in<a href="#RCWM80">
[RCWM80]</a> for lines of neutral and singly-ionized atoms of about half
the elements (mainly nd- and nf-shell metals) were taken at least in part
from <a href="#MCS75">[MCS75]</a>. These intensities were obtained from
observations of 10-A, 220-V direct-current arc discharges between copper
electrodes having 0.1% of the element under investigation. The relative
intensities were put on a linear scale by the use of standardized lamps.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For several spectra we have altered some of
the intensities found in the literature to give smoother transitions between
wavelength regions covered by different observers. We have also adjusted
reported intensities given in a single reference in some cases where the
reported values were clearly affected by strong self-absorption and/or
by large wavelength-dependent non-linearities. Such adjustments were necessary
in order to assign the largest intensities to the inherently strongest
persistent lines (usually the ultimate lines).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lines we have selected as persistent (Sec IV)
are indicated by the letter "P" following the intensity. For some spectra,
other descriptive codes have been included to characterize the line shape
or give other related information. They have the following meanings:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b - band head
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c - complex
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d - line consists
of two unresolved lines
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h - hazy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l - shaded to
longer wavelengths
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P - a persistent
line
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r - easily reversed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s - shaded to
shorter wavelengths
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; u - unresolved
shoulder on strong line
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w - wide
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the character of a line depends
on the spectroscopic source used, the resolution of the spectrometer, etc.
Most of the line characterizations in our tables are quoted from <a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a>,
so that the characters given for lines of metallic elements usually pertain
to the arc source used by Meggers et al. <a href="#MCS75">[MCS75]</a> (see
above). In some cases we have given character notations from <a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a>
for lines for which the tabulated wavelengths were obtained with a very
different (low-pressure) source.
<p><b><i><font size=+1>IV. Persistent-Line Tables</font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spectroscopic observations made with low
concentrations of a particular element relative to other substances in
the source, the number of observable lines of the element is found to decrease
with decreasing concentration until only the most "persistent" or "sensitive"
lines remain. Some authors refer to the last such line(s) as the raie(s)
ultime, i.e., the ultimate line(s). Although the ultimate lines depend
in principle on the source, the spectrometer, and other features of the
experiment, a relatively small group of lines can be specified for each
element that will include the ultimate lines as observed over a broad range
of experimental conditions. We designate our selection of these lines "persistent
lines".
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strongest persistent lines usually include
one or more resonance lines, i.e. transitions to the ground level or term.
We include at least one of the resonance lines in our persistent line table
for each spectrum. The most sensitive or ultimate lines for many spectra
lie in the vacuum-ultraviolet region (wavelength &lt; 2000 &Aring;). In
such cases we have tried to include some lines above 2000 &Aring; in the
persistent lines list. We have also tried to make these tables more generally
useful for many spectra by covering broader wavelength ranges than most
tables of this sort.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the information given in the
strong lines table, the list of persistent lines includes the energy levels
involved in the transition, complete with configuration, term designations,
and J values. Where available, the transition probability is also given,
along with the reference from which it is taken.
<p><b><font size=+0>A. Transition Probabilities</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values are listed as <i>A<sub>ki</sub></i>
in units of 10<sup>8</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. These <i>A<sub>ki</sub></i>
values can easily be converted to oscillator strengths,<i> f<sub>ik</sub></i>,
<i>g<sub>i</sub>f<sub>ik</sub></i>, or log(<i>g<sub>i</sub>f<sub>ik</sub></i>),
or line strength, <i>S</i>, by using the following formula:
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g<sub>i</sub> f<sub>ik</sub></i> = 1.499x10<sup>-8</sup><i>A<sub>ki<img SRC="lambda.gif" ALT="Lambda" height=12 width=9></sub></i><sup>2</sup><i>g<sub>k</sub></i>
= 303.8&nbsp;<img SRC="lambda.gif" ALT="Lambda" height=12 width=9><sup>-1</sup><i>
S</i> ,
<p>where i refers to the lower energy level, k refers to the upper level,&nbsp;<img SRC="lambda.gif" ALT="Lambda" height=12 width=9>
is the wavelength in &Aring;ngstroms, and g = 2J+1 for a given level.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transition probability data are taken primarily
from three compilations and from references cited therein. The NIST compilation
<a href="#FW96">[FW96]</a> contains transition probabilities for about
9000 lines, covering most elements. Major recent compilations by Morton
for elements from H to Ga <a href="#M91">[M91</a>, <a href="#M02">M02</a>]
and from Ge to Bi (plus Th and U) [<a href="#M00">M00</a>] have data for
lines longward of the Lyman limit (911.754 &Aring;) and include a number
of useful new references.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NIST transition-probability compilations
include values with uncertainties ranging from 1% to larger than 50%, with
an approximate uncertainty range being indicated for each line by an assigned
letter. We have not included or assigned such letters here, but this information
is given in the NIST publications and in the ASD for all transition-probability
values taken from these sources. For data taken from the original literature
or from non-NIST compilations, the user can consult the cited references
for accuracy estimates.
<p><b><font size=+0>B. Energy-Level Classifications</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values of the two levels classifying each
line are given under "Energy Levels," with the lower level on the left.
The energy-level classifications for a few persistent lines are not known,
as indicated by the absence of level values. Clicking on one of the level
values yields another page showing the configurations, term names, and
J values for the levels classifying the line. The accuracies and spectroscopic
designations of the levels are discussed in the next section.
<p><b><i><font size=+1>V. Energy Level Tables</font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tabulated energy levels represent a selection
of the available data for each spectrum, including all levels involved
in the persistent-line classifications. At least the lower levels of the
ground configuration and other low-lying configurations are given. The
levels of some of the simpler spectra are given complete up through the
highest tabulated level, but most of the known energy level structures
of the more complex spectra are omitted here. The ionization energies are
included except for a few spectra for which no reliable values are available.
The reference for each level represents the source of the level value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimated uncertainties for the levels can
usually be found in the references. In our tables, the uncertainties are
only roughly indicated by the number of decimal places or significant figures
in the values. The uncertainty corresponding to a particular number of
decimals may easily vary by an order of magnitude, however, even within
the data for one spectrum. In most cases, the uncertainty is probably between
1 and ~30 units in the last decimal place or significant figure, but still
larger errors can occur. The uncertainty in the relative position of two
levels having different uncertainties is at least as large as the greater
of the two level uncertainties. In this regard, it is important to notice
the number of decimals given for the ground level; the uncertainties of
the absolute values of the excited levels and ionization energy are at
least as large as the indicated ground-level uncertainty.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The configuration and term notations are standard
for NIST compilations. Explanations of the notations for the different
coupling schemes and of the arrangement of the data can be found in <a href="#MZH78">[MZH78]</a>,<a href="#MW96">
[MW96]</a> and online as a part of the "Help" section of ASD <a href="#MFKM99">[MFKM99]</a>.
Some levels of complex spectra are given without term names, either because
the level has not been interpreted theoretically or because the calculated
eigenvector for the level yields no meaningful unique name. Some of these
levels have been assigned simple numerical designations under "Term". The
parity of levels lacking designations is indicated by a degree symbol in
the "Term" column for odd-parity levels.
<p><b><i><font size=+1>VI. Finding List</font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This table gives the wavelength, intensity,
spectrum, and reference for each line in this compilation, listed in order
of increasing wavelength. Although this list has fewer lines than the finding
list of <a href="#RCWM80">[RCWM80]</a> or <a href="#MCS75">[MCS75]</a>,
it includes some lines not given in the earlier publications.
